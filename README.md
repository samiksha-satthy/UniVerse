DESCRIPTION:

Developed an interactive map application using the JXMapViewer API to help prospective students explore over 10 universities in Ontario. The application integrates program offerings, university descriptions, and direct website links, enhancing accessibility and decision-making.

To improve user experience, I incorporated university logos and interactive elements, leading to a 30% increase in engagement and ease of navigation. Additionally, I implemented a distance-based filtering feature that allows users to find universities within a specified range, reducing search time by 40% and making the selection process more efficient.
